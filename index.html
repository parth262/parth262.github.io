                Remember the very first time you sent me a poem and
                I was so happy to know that you can write poems.
                And I liked your poem so much that I saved it with me.
                After that day you have written so many poems and I still have every one of them..
                So here are the beautiful poems by AZKA..

              I miss those good old  days,
              where every confusion had it's way;
              Where it was fun  to be with people,
              to laugh off all the pains like a riddle;
              Where every problem was solved with care,
              for which now i got nobody to share;
              Where problem's were just a mere one night stand,
              people played all of it away like member's of a band;
              Where laughter was echoed through one's eyes
              which now, is used to disguise all the lies;
              The simple meaning of words, those days had
              are now turned into metaphors used to depict the hidden land of the sad.

              People say i am so weak at heart
              but for me, this has become a part;
              a part of my heart, my soul, my mind;
              their grubby words have made me blind..
              blind from who i actually am;
              the door of their words straight on me slams.
              They never skipped a moment to show me down
              always greeting me with a smile disguised from a frown.
              They always could find the flaws in me
              but never cud find the happinesss i lost in the sea,
              sea full of their mordant grudges deep
              refraining me from sound sleep;
              but now their words have made me strong,
              paying no heed I'll live my life long.!

              There he walks all joly nd fine
              wondering where he would take his girl to dine
              To make it a perfect surprise he wishes
              but amongst all the wondering what he misses
              Is how sparks flew when the girl saw him
              he was the shining light in the surrounding all dim
              how eagerly she waited for the touch of his hand
              how the smile of his face was all she would demand
              how the happiness in his eyes would shine so bright
              making her heart beat at the speed of light
              amongst his effort of making evrythng perfect
              he could not see how his mere presence made it's own effect!

              What is it in a mother so captivating yet concealed?
              Thought the irresolute boy who was yet a fragile seed.
              The responsibilities of life were nevver his concern,
              and so mother nature thought of giving it a turn;
              Took from him his highly esteemed possession,
              That's when he found the answer to his previous question.
              He was drowned in the pain flowing deep down his vein
              Such catastrophe were not for which he was trained
              The rage and anger made him question the creator:
              "Have you no heart? Are you just a fat proud piece of a traitor!?"
              And then day by day the flame started burning a little lighter
              untill suddenly evverything started looking brighter!
              Hope and Peace he found disguised as a young girl,
              A perfect blend of wisdom and weirdness was what made him swirl.
              He had found something he never thought of was a need,
              Named her an angel not matching any of the globes breed.
              Everyday he started smiling a bit wider,
              knowing he could not have found a better guider:
              And there above, the proud creator smiled
              knowing he answered another question of the boy so blind.

              A sister is like an ocean with an appealing and calm surface
              Dive into mine, and you'll find treasures layed with all grace!
              The exhaustion of the day and the drowsiness of the night
              Takes quite a turn when she comes into sight.
              In the age of 3am friends she is the one who rides the day
              always ready to join you is what makes me slay
              A child hidden in her heart won't let her disguise
              the happiness of small joys that blinks through her iridescent eyes
              Shopping exploring dreaming: to all your desires
              She'll accompany you all along to the end of an umpire
              In this world full of fakeness she'll be the one to entrust
              May the rain of success pour over her and drain all the dust
              And to the world i proudly say
              She's MY sister and I am her's come what may!

              I wish i were the moon
              In a calm night sky dipped in blue
              Would hide from all the goons
              And never return till the dew
              Ah! I won't be seen again anytime soon.

              I wish i were a bat
              On a tree, hanging toe to head
              Sleeping all day without regret
              To wake to a peaceful world: your night as it's said
              Ah! I've got no lives to please with an act.

              I wish i were a shooting star
              Only visible to some few
              Would fall and get expectations at par
              Even if away my life was what I threw.
              Ah! I've got no promises to carry with for far.

              I wish i were anything but me
              The scars underneath for long have been
              The burden of hopes from which I'd be free
              The ocean of cries nowhere to be seen
              Ah! It's won't be a sin to finally breathe.
